Hello You, yes _you_, 

Help for making:

	make help

To recompile and install tleds, just cd to the directory where there is
tleds.c and Makefile, su root, and give command:

	make all install

If you don't want to recompile just: (install needs EUID root)
NOTE: the binaries in the tarball are compiled to use glibc. If you need
to get them working with libc-5, you need to recompile on your machine, or
email me and I'll will put libc5 versions available or mail back to ya.

	make install

For reading man page before it is installed:

	man ./tleds.1

If you want tleds started always in the boot up, do for example:

	echo "/usr/local/bin/tleds -qcd 100 ppp0" >>/etc/rc.d/rc.local

Consider the -c option when running tleds as (EUID) root.

Some ppl have asked what is EUID...it's Effective User ID. So if
you make tleds suid root and run it as normal user, your effective
user ID comes to 0 (= root). I don't recommend making tleds suid root
though. Just su root and run it or put it in the rc.local file.
